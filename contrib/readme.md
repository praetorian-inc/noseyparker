# How to use this file for post filtering
By default noseyparker has no prefiltering options. I came up with this JSON, 
which is derived from the yaml rules. Basically it lets me parse the "JSON" output
with my own program, and use this datafile on the secret types I am interested
in reporting on. Basically the JSON contains a severity, a skip, and a possible
resolution field.
