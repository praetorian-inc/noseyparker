Scan content for secrets

This command uses regex-based rules to identify hardcoded secrets and other potentially sensitive
information in textual content (or in inputs that can have textual content extracted from them).

The findings from scanning are recorded into a datastore. The recorded findings can later be
reported in several formats using the `summarize` and `report` commands.

Several types of inputs can be specified:

- Positional input arguments can be either files or directories. Files are scanned directly;
directories are recursively enumerated and scanned. Any directories encountered that are Git
repositories will have their entire history scanned.

- A Git repository URL can be specified with the `--git-repo=URL` argument. This will cause Nosey
Parker to clone that repository to its datastore and scan its history.

- A GitHub user can be specified with the `--github-user=NAME` argument. This will cause Nosey
Parker to enumerate accessible repositories belonging to that user, clone them to its datastore, and
scan their entire history.

- A GitHub organization can be specified with the `--github-org=NAME` argument. This will cause
Nosey Parker to enumerate accessible repositories belonging to that organization, clone them to its
datastore, and scan their entire history.

The `git` binary on the PATH is used to clone any required Git repositories. It is careful invoked
to avoid using any system-wide or user-specific configuration.

By default, when cloning repositories from GitHub or enumerating GitHub users or organizations,
unauthenticated access is used. An optional personal access token can be specified using the
`NP_GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. Using a personal access token gives higher rate limits and
may make additional content accessible.

Usage: noseyparker scan [OPTIONS] --datastore <PATH> [INPUT]...

Options:
  -d, --datastore <PATH>
          Use the specified datastore
          
          The datastore will be created if it does not exist.
          
          [env: NP_DATASTORE=]

  -j, --jobs <N>
          Use N parallel scanning jobs
          
          [default: DEFAULT]

      --snippet-length <BYTES>
          Include up to the specified number of bytes before and after each match
          
          The default value typically gives between 4 and 7 lines of context before and after each
          match.
          
          [default: 256]

  -r, --rules <PATH>
          Use custom rules from the specified file or directory
          
          The paths can be either files or directories. Directories are recursively walked and all
          discovered rule files will be loaded.
          
          This option can be repeated.

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Input Specifier Options:
  [INPUT]...
          Scan the specified file, directory, or local Git repository

      --git-url <URL>
          Clone and scan the Git repository at the specified URL
          
          Only https URLs without credentials, query parameters, or fragment identifiers are
          supported.
          
          This option can be repeated.

      --github-organization <NAME>
          Clone and scan accessible repositories belonging to the specified GitHub organization
          
          This option can be repeated.
          
          [aliases: github-org]

      --github-user <NAME>
          Clone and scan accessible repositories belonging to the specified GitHub user
          
          This option can be repeated.

      --github-api-url <URL>
          Use the specified URL for GitHub API access
          
          If accessing a GitHub Enterprise Server instance, this value should be the entire base URL
          include the `api/v3` portion, e.g., `https://github.example.com/api/v3`.
          
          [default: https://api.github.com/]
          [aliases: api-url]

      --git-clone-mode <MODE>
          Use the specified method for cloning Git repositories
          
          [default: bare]

          Possible values:
          - bare:   Match the behavior of `git clone --bare`
          - mirror: Match the behavior of `git clone --mirror`

Content Filtering Options:
      --max-file-size <MEGABYTES>
          Do not scan files larger than the specified size
          
          The value is parsed as a floating point literal, and hence fractional values can be
          supplied. A negative value means "no limit". Note that scanning requires reading the
          entire contents of each file into memory, so using an excessively large limit may be
          problematic.
          
          [default: 100]

  -i, --ignore <FILE>
          Use custom path-based ignore rules from the specified file
          
          The ignore file should contain gitignore-style rules.
          
          This option can be repeated.

Global Options:
  -v, --verbose...
          Enable verbose output
          
          This can be repeated up to 3 times to enable successively more output.

      --color <MODE>
          Enable or disable colored output
          
          When this is "auto", colors are enabled when stdout is a tty.
          
          If the `NO_COLOR` environment variable is set, it takes precedence and is equivalent to
          `--color=never`.
          
          [default: auto]
          [possible values: auto, never, always]

      --progress <MODE>
          Enable or disable progress bars
          
          When this is "auto", progress bars are enabled when stderr is a tty.
          
          [default: auto]
          [possible values: auto, never, always]

Advanced Global Options:
      --rlimit-nofile <LIMIT>
          Set the rlimit for number of open files to LIMIT
          
          This should not need to be changed from the default unless you run into crashes from
          running out of file descriptors.
          
          [default: 16384]

      --enable-backtraces <BOOL>
          Enable or disable backtraces on panic
          
          This has the effect of setting the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable to 1.
          
          [default: true]
          [possible values: true, false]
