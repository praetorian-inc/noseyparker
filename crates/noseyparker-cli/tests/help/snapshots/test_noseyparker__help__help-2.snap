Global Options:
  -v, --verbose...
          Enable verbose output
          
          This can be repeated up to 3 times to enable successively more output.

      --color <MODE>
          Enable or disable colored output
          
          When this is "auto", colors are enabled when stdout is a tty.
          
          If the `NO_COLOR` environment variable is set, it takes precedence and is equivalent to
          `--color=never`.
          
          [default: auto]
          [possible values: auto, never, always]

      --progress <MODE>
          Enable or disable progress bars
          
          When this is "auto", progress bars are enabled when stderr is a tty.
          
          [default: auto]
          [possible values: auto, never, always]

Advanced Global Options:
      --rlimit-nofile <LIMIT>
          Set the rlimit for number of open files to LIMIT
          
          This should not need to be changed from the default unless you run into crashes from
          running out of file descriptors.
          
          [default: 16384]

      --enable-backtraces <BOOL>
          Enable or disable backtraces on panic
          
          This has the effect of setting the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable to 1.
          
          [default: true]
          [possible values: true, false]
