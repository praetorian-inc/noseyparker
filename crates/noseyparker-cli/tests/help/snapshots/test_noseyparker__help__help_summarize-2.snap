Summarize scan findings

Findings are summarized in tabular form. The default `human` format prints a table of findings with
one row for each rule that produced findings. The table has several columns:

- Rule: the name of the rule

- Findings: the number of findings, i.e., the number of distinct match group values produced by the
rule

- Matches: the number of individual matches

- Accepted: the number of findings whose matches have `accept` status

- Rejected: the number of findings whose matches have `reject` status

- Mixed: the number of findings whose matches have a mix of `accept` and `reject` status

- Unlabeled: the number of findings whose matches have no status at all

Usage: noseyparker summarize [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -d, --datastore <PATH>
          Use the specified datastore
          
          [env: NP_DATASTORE=]
          [default: datastore.np]

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Output Options:
  -o, --output <PATH>
          Write output to the specified path
          
          If this argument is not provided, stdout will be used.

  -f, --format <FORMAT>
          Write output in the specified format
          
          [default: human]

          Possible values:
          - human: A text-based format designed for humans
          - json:  Pretty-printed JSON format
          - jsonl: JSON Lines format

Global Options:
  -v, --verbose...
          Enable verbose output
          
          This can be repeated up to 3 times to enable successively more output.

  -q, --quiet
          Suppress non-error feedback messages
          
          This silences WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, and TRACE messages and disables progress bars. This
          overrides any provided verbosity and progress reporting options.

      --color <MODE>
          Enable or disable colored output
          
          When this is "auto", colors are enabled for stdout and stderr when they are terminals.
          
          If the `NO_COLOR` environment variable is set, it takes precedence and is equivalent to
          `--color=never`.
          
          [default: auto]
          [possible values: auto, never, always]

      --progress <MODE>
          Enable or disable progress bars
          
          When this is "auto", progress bars are enabled when stderr is a terminal.
          
          [default: auto]
          [possible values: auto, never, always]

      --ignore-certs
          Ignore validation of TLS certificates

Advanced Global Options:
      --rlimit-nofile <LIMIT>
          Set the rlimit for number of open files to LIMIT
          
          This should not need to be changed from the default unless you run into crashes from
          running out of file descriptors.
          
          [default: 16384]

      --sqlite-cache-size <SIZE>
          Set the cache size for SQLite connections to SIZE
          
          This has the effect of setting SQLite's `pragma cache_size=SIZE`. The default value is set
          to use a maximum of 1GiB for database cache. See
          <https://sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_cache_size> for more details.
          
          [default: -1048576]

      --enable-backtraces <BOOL>
          Enable or disable backtraces on panic
          
          This has the effect of setting the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable to 1.
          
          [default: true]
          [possible values: true, false]
