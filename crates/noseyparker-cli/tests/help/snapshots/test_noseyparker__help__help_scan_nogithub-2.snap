Scan content for secrets

This command uses regex-based rules to identify hardcoded secrets and other potentially sensitive
information in textual content (or in inputs that can have textual content extracted from them).

The findings from scanning are recorded into a datastore. The recorded findings can later be
reported in several formats using the `summarize` and `report` commands.

Several types of inputs can be specified:

- Positional input arguments can be either files or directories. Files are scanned directly;
directories are recursively enumerated and scanned. Any directories encountered that are Git
repositories will have their entire history scanned.

- A Git repository URL can be specified with the `--git-repo=URL` argument. This will cause Nosey
Parker to clone that repository to its datastore and scan its history.

The `git` binary on the PATH is used to clone any required Git repositories. It is careful invoked
to avoid using any system-wide or user-specific configuration.

Usage: noseyparker scan [OPTIONS] [INPUT]...

Options:
  -d, --datastore <PATH>
          Use the specified datastore
          
          The datastore will be created if it does not exist.
          
          [env: NP_DATASTORE=]
          [default: datastore.np]

  -j, --jobs <N>
          Use N parallel scanning threads
          
          [default: DEFAULT]

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Rule Selection Options:
      --rules-path <PATH>
          Load additional rules and rulesets from the specified file or directory
          
          The paths can be either files or directories. Directories are recursively walked and all
          discovered YAML files of rules and rulesets will be loaded.
          
          This option can be repeated.

      --ruleset <ID>
          Enable the ruleset with the specified ID
          
          The ID must resolve to a built-in ruleset or to an additional ruleset loaded with the
          `--rules=PATH` option.
          
          The special `all` ID causes all loaded rules to be used.
          
          This option can be repeated.
          
          Specifying this option disables the default ruleset. If you want to use a custom ruleset
          in addition to the default ruleset, specify this option twice, e.g., `--ruleset default
          --ruleset CUSTOM_ID`.
          
          [default: default]

      --load-builtins <BOOL>
          Control whether built-in rules and rulesets are loaded
          
          [default: true]
          [possible values: true, false]

Input Specifier Options:
  [INPUT]...
          Scan the specified file, directory, or local Git repository

      --git-url <URL>
          Clone and scan the Git repository at the specified URL
          
          Only https URLs without credentials, query parameters, or fragment identifiers are
          supported.
          
          This option can be repeated.

      --enumerator <PATH>
          Read inputs from a JSONL enumerator file (experimental)
          
          This can be used to stream inputs from other processes without having to write them to
          disk. Shell process substitution (e.g., `--enumerator=<(my-enumerator-program)`) can make
          this ergonomic.
          
          Each line of the enumerator file should be a JSON object with one of the following forms:
          
          { "content_base64": "base64-encoded bytestring to scan", "provenance": <arbitrary object>
          } { "content": "utf8 string to scan", "provenance": <arbitrary object> }
          
          This option can be repeated.

      --git-clone <MODE>
          Use the specified method for cloning Git repositories
          
          [default: bare]

          Possible values:
          - bare:   Match the behavior of `git clone --bare`
          - mirror: Match the behavior of `git clone --mirror`

      --git-history <MODE>
          Use the specified mode for handling Git history
          
          Git history can be completely ignored when scanning by using `--git-history=none`. Note
          that this will interfere with other input specifiers that cause Git repositories to be
          automatically cloned. For example, specifying an input with `--git-url=<URL>` while
          simultaneously using `--git-history=none` will not result in useful scanning.
          
          [default: full]

          Possible values:
          - full: Scan all history
          - none: Scan no history

Content Filtering Options:
      --max-file-size <MEGABYTES>
          Do not scan files larger than the specified size
          
          The value is parsed as a floating point literal, and hence fractional values can be
          supplied. A non-positive value means "no limit". Note that scanning requires reading the
          entire contents of each file into memory, so using an excessively large limit may be
          problematic.
          
          [default: 100]

  -i, --ignore <FILE>
          Use custom path-based ignore rules from the specified file
          
          The ignore file should contain gitignore-style rules.
          
          This option can be repeated.

Metadata Collection Options:
      --blob-metadata <MODE>
          Specify which blobs will have metadata recorded
          
          [default: matching]

          Possible values:
          - all:      Record metadata for all encountered blobs
          - matching: Record metadata only for blobs with matches
          - none:     Record metadata for no blobs

      --git-blob-provenance <MODE>
          Specify which Git commit provenance metadata will be collected
          
          This should not need to be changed unless you are running into performance problems on a
          problematic Git repository input.
          
          [default: first-seen]

          Possible values:
          - first-seen: The Git repository and set of commits and accompanying pathnames in which a
            blob is first seen
          - minimal:    Only the Git repository in which a blob is seen

      --copy-blobs-format <FORMAT>
          Specify the format for blobs copied by the `--copy-blobs` option
          
          [default: files]

          Possible values:
          - files: Plain files, similar to Git's loose object format

Data Collection Options:
      --snippet-length <BYTES>
          Include up to the specified number of bytes before and after each match
          
          The default value typically gives between 4 and 7 lines of context before and after each
          match.
          
          [default: 256]

      --copy-blobs <MODE>
          Specify which blobs will be copied in entirety to the datastore
          
          If this option is enabled, corresponding blobs will be written to the `blobs` directory
          within the datastore. The format of that directory is similar to Git's "loose" object
          format: the first 2 characters of the hex-encoded blob ID name a subdirectory, and the
          remaining characters are used as the filename.
          
          This mechanism exists to aid in ad-hoc downstream investigation. Copied blobs are not used
          elsewhere in Nosey Parker at this point.
          
          [default: none]

          Possible values:
          - all:      Copy all encountered blobs
          - matching: Copy only blobs with matches
          - none:     Copy no blobs

Global Options:
  -v, --verbose...
          Enable verbose output
          
          This can be repeated up to 3 times to enable successively more output.

  -q, --quiet
          Suppress non-error feedback messages
          
          This silences WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, and TRACE messages and disables progress bars. This
          overrides any provided verbosity and progress reporting options.

      --color <MODE>
          Enable or disable colored output
          
          When this is "auto", colors are enabled for stdout and stderr when they are terminals.
          
          If the `NO_COLOR` environment variable is set, it takes precedence and is equivalent to
          `--color=never`.
          
          [default: auto]
          [possible values: auto, never, always]

      --progress <MODE>
          Enable or disable progress bars
          
          When this is "auto", progress bars are enabled when stderr is a terminal.
          
          [default: auto]
          [possible values: auto, never, always]

      --ignore-certs
          Ignore validation of TLS certificates

Advanced Global Options:
      --rlimit-nofile <LIMIT>
          Set the rlimit for number of open files to LIMIT
          
          This should not need to be changed from the default unless you run into crashes from
          running out of file descriptors.
          
          [default: 16384]

      --sqlite-cache-size <SIZE>
          Set the cache size for SQLite connections to SIZE
          
          This has the effect of setting SQLite's `pragma cache_size=SIZE`. The default value is set
          to use a maximum of 1GiB for database cache. See
          <https://sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_cache_size> for more details.
          
          [default: -1048576]

      --enable-backtraces <BOOL>
          Enable or disable backtraces on panic
          
          This has the effect of setting the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable to 1.
          
          [default: true]
          [possible values: true, false]
