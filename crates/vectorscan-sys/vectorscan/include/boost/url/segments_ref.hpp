/** A view representing path segments in a URL

    Objects of this type are used to interpret
    the path as a bidirectional view of segments,
    where each segment is a string with percent
    escapes automatically decoded.

    The view does not retain ownership of the
    elements and instead references the original
    character buffer. The caller is responsible
    for ensuring that the lifetime of the buffer
    extends until it is no longer referenced.

    The view is modifiable; calling non-const
    members causes changes to the referenced
    url.

    @par Example
    @code
    url u( "/path/to/file.txt" );

    segments_ref ps = u.segments();
    @endcode

    Percent escapes in strings returned when
    dereferencing iterators are automatically
    decoded.
    Reserved characters in strings supplied
    to modifier functions are automatically
    percent-escaped.

    @par Iterator Invalidation
    Changes to the underlying character buffer
    can invalidate iterators which reference it.
    Modifications made through the container
    invalidate some or all iterators:
    <br>

    @li @ref push_back : Only `end()`.

    @li @ref assign, @ref clear,
        @ref operator= : All elements.

    @li @ref erase : Erased elements and all
        elements after (including `end()`).

    @li @ref insert : All elements at or after
        the insertion point (including `end()`).

    @li @ref replace : Modified
        elements and all elements
        after (including `end()`).

        @ref segments_encoded_ref,
        @ref segments_encoded_view,
        @ref segments_view.
