    @details This is an alias template used as the return type
    for functions that can either return a container,
    or fail with an error code. This is a brief
    synopsis of the type:

    @par Declaration
    @code
    template< class T >
    class result
    {
    public:
        //
        // Return true if the result contains an error
        //
        constexpr bool has_error() const noexcept;

        //
        // Return the error
        //
        constexpr system::error_code error() const noexcept;

        //
        // Return true if the result contains a value
        //
        constexpr bool has_value() const noexcept;
        constexpr explicit operator bool() const noexcept;

        //
        // Return the value, or throw an exception
        //
        constexpr T& value();
        constexpr T const& value() const;

        // Return the value.
        // Precondition: has_value()==true
        //
        constexpr T& operator*() noexcept;
        constexpr T* operator->() noexcept;
        constexpr T const& operator*() const noexcept;
        constexpr T const* operator->() const noexcept;

    @endcode

    @par Usage
    Given the function @ref parse_uri with this signature:
    @code
    system::result< url_view > parse_uri( core::string_view s ) noexcept;
    @endcode

    The following statement captures the value in a
    variable upon success, otherwise throws:
    @code
    url_view u = parse_uri( "http://example.com/path/to/file.txt" ).value();
    @endcode

    This statement captures the result in a local
    variable and inspects the error condition:
    @code
    system::result< url_view > rv = parse_uri( "http://example.com/path/to/file.txt" );

    if(! rv )
        std::cout << rv.error();
    else
        std::cout << *rv;
    @endcode

    @tparam T The type of value held by the result.

        @li <a href="https://boost.org/libs/system/doc/html/system.html#ref_resultt_e"
