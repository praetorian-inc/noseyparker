    Credentials were found in a `Connect-VIServer` invocation.
    `Connect-VIServer` is a command to connect to a VMWare vCenter Server.
    An attacker may be able to use these credentials to authenticate to vSphere instances, and depending on the associated privileges, administrate the resources such as Virtual Machines.

  examples:
  - 'Connect-VIServer -Server 192.168.1.51 -User administrator@vSphere.local -Password VMware1!'
  - |
      #Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -InvalidCertificateAction:Ignore
      Connect-VIServer "$endpoint" -User "$username" -Password "$password" | Out-Null
  - 'Connect-VIServer $ESXiHost.EsxiHost -user $ESXiUser -password $ESXipass'
  - '$null = connect-viserver vc.lab.local -user administrator@vsphere.local -password VMware1!'
