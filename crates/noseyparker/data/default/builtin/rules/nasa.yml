  description: >
    A NASA API key was found.
    This API key allows access to several rate-limited APIs.
    An attacker could use this API key to consume limited resources and cause denial of service.

  examples:
  - |
      get('https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/earth/imagery?api_key=fWfSMcDzyHfMuH8BW6jiIUBYaj0hKRyKBRTBqgEQ')
        .then(function(response) {
          // There is an issue with the image being pulled from the API, so using a different one instead
          document.getElementsByClassName('targetImage')[0].src = "https://api.nasa.gov/images/earth.png";
