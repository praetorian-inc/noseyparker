## Summarize findings

Nosey Parker prints out a summary of its findings when it finishes scanning.
You can also run this step separately after scanning:
```
$ noseyparker summarize --datastore np.cpython

 Rule                      Distinct Groups   Total Matches
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 PEM-Encoded Private Key             1,076           1,192
 Generic Secret                        331             478
 netrc Credentials                      42           3,201

 md5crypt Hash                           1               2
```
