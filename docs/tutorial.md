# Tutorial

!!! note "Getting help"

    Running the `noseyparker` binary without arguments prints top-level help and exits.
    You can get abbreviated help for a particular command by running `noseyparker COMMAND -h`.
    More detailed help is available with the `help` command or long-form `--help` option.

!!! note "Man pages"

    The prebuilt releases include manpages that collect the command-line help in one place.
    These are also available [in this documentation](commands/index.md).

!!! note "Other questions"

    If you have a question that's not answered by this documentation, please [start a discussion](https://github.com/praetorian-inc/noseyparker/discussions/new/choose).

The typical workflow is three phases:

1. Scan inputs of interest using the `scan` command
2. Report details of scan results using the `report` command
3. Review and triage findings
