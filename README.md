# Nosey Parker: Find secrets in textual data

Nosey Parker is a command-line tool that finds secrets and sensitive information in textual data. It is useful both for offensive and defensive security testing.

**Key features:**
- It supports scanning files, directories, and the entire history of Git repositories
- It uses regular expression matching with a set of 88 patterns chosen for high signal-to-noise based on experience and feedback from offensive security engagements
- It groups matches together that share the same secret, further emphasizing signal over noise
- It is fast: it can scan at hundreds of megabytes per second on a single core, and is able to scan 100GB of Linux kernel source history in less than 2 minutes on an older MacBook Pro

This open-source version of Nosey Parker is a reimplementation of the internal version in use at Praetorian. The internal version has additional capabilities for false positive suppression and an alternative machine learning-based detection engine.

## Building from source

**1. (On x86_64) Install the [Hyperscan](https://github.com/intel/hyperscan) library and headers for your system**

On macOS using Homebrew:

```
brew install hyperscan pkg-config
```

On Ubuntu 22.04:

```
apt install libhyperscan-dev pkg-config
```

**1. (On non-x86_64) Build [Vectorscan](https://github.com/Vectorcamp/vectorscan) from source**

You will need several dependencies, including `cmake`, `boost`, `ragel`, and `pkg-config`.

Download and extract the source for the [5.4.8 release](https://github.com/VectorCamp/vectorscan/releases/tag/vectorscan%2F5.4.8) of Vectorscan:

```
wget https://github.com/VectorCamp/vectorscan/archive/refs/tags/vectorscan/5.4.8.tar.gz && tar xfz 5.4.8.tar.gz
```

Build with cmake:

```
cd vectorscan-vectorscan-5.4.8 && cmake -B build -DFAT_RUNTIME=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release . && cmake --build build
```

Set the `HYPERSCAN_ROOT` environment variable so that Nosey Parker builds against your from-source build of Vectorscan:

```
export HYPERSCAN_ROOT="$PWD/build"
```

**Note:** The Nosey Parker [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) builds Vectorscan from source and links against that.


**2. Install the Rust toolchain**

Recommended approach: install from <https://rustup.rs>

**3. Build using [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)**

```
cargo build --release
```
This will produce a binary at `target/release/noseyparker`.

## Docker Usage

**A [prebuilt Docker image](https://ghcr.io/praetorian-inc/noseyparker:latest) is available for the latest release for x86_64:**

```
docker pull ghcr.io/praetorian-inc/noseyparker:latest
```

**A [prebuilt Docker image](https://ghcr.io/praetorian-inc/noseyparker:edge) is available for the most recent commit for x86_64:**

```
docker pull ghcr.io/praetorian-inc/noseyparker:edge
```

**For other architectures (e.g., ARM) you will need to build the Docker image yourself:**

```
docker build -t noseyparker .
```

**Run the Docker image with a mounted volume:**

```
docker run -v "$PWD":/opt/ noseyparker
```

**Note:** The Docker image runs noticeably slower than a native binary, particularly on macOS.


## Usage quick start

### The datastore
Most Nosey Parker commands use a _datastore_.
This is a special directory that Nosey Parker uses to record its findings and maintain its internal state.
A datastore will be implicitly created by the `scan` command if needed.
You can also create a datastore explicitly using the `datastore init -d PATH` command.


### Scanning filesystem content for secrets
Nosey Parker has built-in support for scanning files, recursively scanning directories, and scanning the entire history of Git repositories.

For example, if you have a Git clone of [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython) locally at `cpython.git`, you can scan its entire history with the `scan` command.
Nosey Parker will create a new datastore at `np.cpython` and saves its findings there.
```
$ noseyparker scan --datastore np.cpython cpython.git
Found 28.30 GiB from 18 plain files and 427,712 blobs from 1 Git repos [00:00:04]
Scanning content  ████████████████████ 100%  28.30 GiB/28.30 GiB  [00:00:53]
Scanned 28.30 GiB from 427,730 blobs in 54 seconds (538.46 MiB/s); 4,904/4,904 new matches

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

 Generic Secret                        331             478
 netrc Credentials                      42           3,201
 Generic API Key                         2              31
 md5crypt Hash                           1               2

Run the `report` command next to show finding details.
```

You can specify multiple inputs to scan at once in any combination of the supported input types (files, directories, and Git repos).


### Summarizing findings
Nosey Parker prints out a summary of its findings when it finishes
scanning.  You can also run this step separately:
```
$ noseyparker summarize --datastore np.cpython

 Rule                      Distinct Groups   Total Matches
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

 md5crypt Hash                           1               2
```

Additional output formats are supported, including JSON and JSON lines, via the `--format=FORMAT` option.


### Reporting detailed findings
To see details of Nosey Parker's findings, use the `report` command.
This prints out a text-based report designed for human consumption:
```
$ noseyparker report --datastore np.cpython

(Note: the findings above are synthetic, invalid secrets.)
Additional output formats are supported, including JSON and JSON lines, via the `--format=FORMAT` option.


### Enumerating repositories from GitHub
To list URLs for repositories belonging to GitHub users or organizations, use the `github repos list` command.
This command uses the GitHub REST API to enumerate repositories belonging to one or more users or organizations.
For example:
```
$ noseyparker github repos list --user octocat
https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World.git
https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git
https://github.com/octocat/boysenberry-repo-1.git
https://github.com/octocat/git-consortium.git
https://github.com/octocat/hello-worId.git
https://github.com/octocat/linguist.git
https://github.com/octocat/octocat.github.io.git
https://github.com/octocat/test-repo1.git
```

An optional GitHub Personal Access Token can be provided via the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.
Providing an access token gives a higher API rate limit and may make additional repositories accessible to you.

Additional output formats are supported, including JSON and JSON lines, via the `--format=FORMAT` option.


### Getting help
Running the `noseyparker` binary without arguments prints top-level help and exits.
You can get abbreviated help for a particular command by running `noseyparker COMMAND -h`.
More detailed help is available with the `help` command.
For example:
```
$ noseyparker scan -h
