## Unreleased

### Additions
- Nosey Parker now has an optional `rule_profiling` crate feature that causes performance-related statistics to be collected and reported when scanning.
  This feature imposes some performance cost and is only useful to rule authors, and so is disabled by default.

- Several new rules have been added:

  - Age Identity (X22519 secret key)
  - Age Recipient (X25519 public key)
  - crates.io API Key
  - DigitalOcean Application Access Token
  - DigitalOcean Personal Access Token
  - DigitalOcean Refresh Token
  - GitLab Personal Access Token
  - GitLab Pipeline Trigger Token
  - GitLab Runner Registration Token
  - New Relic API Service Key
  - New Relic Admin API Key
  - New Relic Insights Insert Key
  - New Relic Insights Query Key
  - New Relic License Key
  - New Relic License Key (non-suffixed)
  - New Relic Pixie API Key
  - New Relic Pixie Deploy Key
  - New Relic REST API Key
  - NPM Access Token (fine-grained)
  - RubyGems API Key

  These rules match token formats that are well-specified fixed-length strings with notable prefixes or suffixes, and so should produce very few false positives.

- Several existing rules were modified to improve signal-to-noise:

  - Credentials in ODBC Connection String
  - PyPI Upload Token

### Changes
- Several default rules have been revised to improve performance of the matching engine and to produce fewer false positives.
  In particular, several rules previously had avoided using a trailing `\b` anchor after secret content which could include a literal `-` character, due to a matching discrepancy between Hyperscan and Rust's `regex` library.
  These have been revised to use a more complicated but functional anchoring pattern.

- Blobs are now deduplicated at enumeration time when first enumerating a Git repository, rather than only at scan time. This results in more accurate progress bars.
