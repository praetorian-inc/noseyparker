# `vectorscan`

## Overview
This crate exposes a more ergonomic Rust interface on top of the raw C bindings to [https://github.com/Vectorcamp/vectorscan](Vectorscan) that are exposed in the `vectorscan-sys` crate.

This crate was adapted from the [https://github.com/vlaci/pyperscan](pyperscan) project, which uses Rust to expose Hyperscan to Python.
(That project is released under both the Apache 2.0 and MIT licenses.)
